This project is mainly about my experience participating in RoboMaster 2018 (Oct 2017 - Aug 2018), RoboMaster 2019 (Sep 2018 - Aug 2019).

In this competition, our team should design 7 robots and build communication between robots and keyboard mouse, using image senor equiped on the robots to fight with other teams' robots from the first perspective in a basketball court sized field.

In the team, I served as the head of the visual group, which should provide visual assistance to robots. There are two main works for the visual group: \\
(1) <b>Visual aiming and shooting. </b> Automatically recognize the enemies by cameras and perform precise shooting, <i>e.g.</i>, operator could simply hold down the right mouse button to enable the robots to automatically aim and shoot enemies. \\
(2) <b>Energy mechanism shooting. </b> An energy mechanism in the map could provide a Buff for the team successfully activating it. There are different to activate energy mechanisms each year:

In <b>RoboMaster 2018</b>, our robots should recognize the 5 digits in Nixie tubes, then shoot the digits of 9 LEDs below in order. After successfully hitting one digit each time, the order of the 9 digits in the LED will be randomly reset. Besides, if a certain digit is shot incorrectly or if the interval between two shots exceeds 1.5 seconds, it needs to be reactivated.

In <b>RoboMaster 2019</b>, our robots need to recognize the rotating windmill from 8 meters away and shoot the glowing blades in order. Additionally, if the wrong blade is shot or if the interval between two shots exceeds 2 seconds, it needs to be reactivated.

Additionally, I'm an operator who controls robot 4 (5 in National Competition) to confront the opponents.
