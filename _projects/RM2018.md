This project is mainly about my experience participating in RoboMaster 2018 (Oct 2017 - Aug 2018), RoboMaster 2019 (Sep 2018 - Aug 2019).

In this competition, our team should design 7 robots to fight with that of other teams in a basketball court sized field.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
