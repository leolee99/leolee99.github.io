I'm a master student in computer science at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I am a member of Center for Future Media [**(CFM)**](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/index) and co-advised by [**Prof. Jingkuan Song**](https://jingkuansong.github.io/) and [**Prof. Lianli Gao**](https://lianligao.github.io/). Now, I'm a visiting student at [**NExT++**](https://www.nextcenter.org/) supervised by [**Prof. Tat-Seng Chua**](https://www.chuatatseng.com/).

I received a B.S. in computer science from Northeast Forest University in 2021, where I joined the Robot Team Ares and participated in a cool international robot competition of [**RoboMaster**](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) [**(details)**](https://leolee99.github.io/projects/RoboMaster/) for two years. 

My research interest mainly lies on <b>Multimodal</b> and <b>Robotics</b>. Currently Iâ€™m working on <b>Multimodal Learning</b>, <b>Robust Learning</b>, and <b>Multimodal Theory</b>.
