I'm a master student in computer science at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I am co-advised by Prof. [Jingkuan Song](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~songjingkuan/) and Prof. [Lianli Gao](https://lianligao.github.io/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
